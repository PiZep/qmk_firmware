# AZERTY layout

AZERTY layout, based on the default layout with combos.

## Combos
Three combos files used:
* `pizep-accents-help.def`: commonly used french accentuated letters and dead
  accents, with some combos from default `gergoplex.def`
* `pizep-more-movements.def`: added combos for movements on the NUMB layer,
* `pizep-azerty-vim-helpers.def`: readapted `germ-vim-helpers.def` for azerty
  layout.

## Notes about numbers
Numpad number are used to add combos on the number layout, as numbers are
shifted characters.
