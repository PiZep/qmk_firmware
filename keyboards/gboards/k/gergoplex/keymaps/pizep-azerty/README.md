# AZERTY layout

AZERTY layout, based on the default layout with combos.

## Combos
Three combos files used:
* `pizep-accents-help.def`: commonly used french accentuated letters and dead
  accents, with some combos from default `gergoplex.def`
* `pizep-more-movements.def`: added combos for movements on the NUMB layer,
* `pizep-azerty-vim-helpers.def`: readapted `germ-vim-helpers.def` for azerty
  layout.

## Note about numbers
Numpad numbers are used to add combos on the number layout, as numbers are
shifted characters in azerty. Hence num lock is always turned on, based on
drashna's answer in [#2164](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/2164)
